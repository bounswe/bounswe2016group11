	/*
	 * Code Conventions for Group 11
	 * 
	 * Class, method, and variable naming: separate words concatenated,
	 * all first letters capitalized except the first word.
	 * 
	 * Example: anExampleVariable, anExampleClass
	 * 
	 * Indentation and bracketization: All embedded content should be indented one "tab" character,
	 * compared to the code that belongs to one level higher. Brackets start from the same line, 
	 * and ends aligned with the initializing code. The closing brackets are the only symbols on a line.
	 * 
	 * Example:
	 * for(int i = 0; i<10; i++){
	 * 		if(true){
	 * 			System.out.println("Code conventions.");
	 * 		}
	 * }
	 */
